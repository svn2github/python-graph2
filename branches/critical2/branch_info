Provided with 2 new algorithms:
- critical path algorithm implemented with the dynamic programming principle
- an algorithm that detects and returns all the transitive edges within the graph
Both algorithms are only meaningful for directed acyclic [weighted] graphs. 

ADDED:
- examples/ex_critical.py
- graph/algorithms/critical.py
- branch_info

INFO:
- feel free to mail me for more info: tomaz.kovacic@gmail.com

NEW:
- transitivive_edges function
- critical_path function
